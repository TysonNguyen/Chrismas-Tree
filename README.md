# Project : Christmas Tree
## Overview
This project will use and Arduino Pro Micro and LED to create a Christmas Tree. The LED will create a shape of the tree and
the micro controller will be use decide which LED to light up. Sequencing will also be add into the micro controller so user
can choose which one to display.
## Component use
* Arduino Micro Pro
* 10 Red LED
* 9 1k Ohms Resistor
* 5 2N3904 NPN BJT
* 2 Tactile switches
## Feature
* Having 3 difference sequences so the user can changes between them
* This is open source so user can download the code and change

## Steps to set up
1. Soldering or placing componets on breadboard as the wiring diagram display to see the full effect
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Copy the code from the Christmas.ino file
4. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE
5. Click the Upload button to upload the code to your Arduino
## Future Improvements
For multiplexing, this way is currently safe but still not a great way to do so. A usage of MUX-24 would improve this project further.
On top of that, a more friendly UI would be a great enhancement for the future
